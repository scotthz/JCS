      >Hey guys! Hope you all had a good weekend and that you are remaining socially distant! :) I will have grades updated in IC later today. If you didn't submit a Google Form, I will note the date of that missed submission in the comments. As posted in the instructions, if you are unable to do the workout posted, please email me THAT day and let me know so I can get you your make up work. I will not send out make up work for days previously missed.

      >The workout for this week is posted under the PE/Team Sports workout post so please refer to that for this week. If you are unable to complete your run/walk due to weather, I have posted links to videos in the comments under your workout (one for today and one for tomorrow) for you to follow along with and workout inside. As we did with last week, submit a Google Form each day after your workout for points. The form is open from 9am to 9pm.
